# Challenge_01: 01 HTML CSS Git - Code Refactor

## Description

The first week challenge is on-thee-job ticket, in which I must modify the starter code to enhance the web accessibility. In order to succeed the challenge, I must surpass the accessibility standard by these following tasks: Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code; HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning; image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes; heading attributes fall in sequential order; title elements contain a concise, descriptive title. I tried my best, asked for advices from fellows and tutors, and Wallah! Let's see how it goes.
